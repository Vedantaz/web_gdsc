The interviewers were very\r\n                      friendly and made sure I’m comfortable. A little\r\n                      nervousness always kicks in which made me miss an\r\n                      important point in the introduction. Also, I described my\r\n                      hobby as writing and mentioned my writing profile. I\r\n                      didn’t expect the interviewer to ask about my profile\r\n                      link. I wasn’t ready with it and hence he asked me to mail\r\n                      it to him after the interview. So along with the link, I\r\n                      also mailed that important point that I had missed. I\r\n                      wasn’t sure if I should do that or not but it’s at least\r\n                      better than having regrets. Therefore keep all your\r\n                      profiles and links handy.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                  </ol>\r\n                  <h3>My experience as a GDSC Lead- </h3>\r\n                  <ol>\r\n                    <li>The Selection Day-</li>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        So it was a rainy evening in the month of August. It was\r\n                        raining heavily which caused a power cut. I was at home\r\n                        and we were having a good family time, enjoying the rain\r\n                        and talking about our old days.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        My phone rang and I went to my room to pick up the call\r\n                        and the moment I was going to shut my phone off, I saw\r\n                        an email notification from Advocu - GDSC. Even before I\r\n                        opened it, my heart had already started pumping.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        I read the first line and I was so damn excited that I\r\n                        couldn’t even sit patiently to read the entire email. I\r\n                        reread the first line and jumped out of excitement. So\r\n                        much excitement that I didn’t even notice the tears of\r\n                        joy flowing out of my eyes. I ran towards the living\r\n                        room, shared the news and that was probably the best day\r\n                        of my college life.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Here is a glimpse of the mail that I received - <a\r\n                          href=\"https://bit.ly/3wO0T5I\"\r\n                          target=\"_blank\"\r\n                          rel=\"noreferrer\"\r\n                          className=\"text-primary\"\r\n                        >\r\n                          https://bit.ly/3wO0T5I\r\n                        </a>\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Although, I was also sad for 2 of my equally capable\r\n                        friends who gave the interviews. But they were happy\r\n                        too, at least we now had a GDSC at our campus.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <li>Further steps - </li>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        We had an amazing introductory session by GDSC India\r\n                        where I got to connect with all the leads around the\r\n                        country.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Now the next step was to introduce GDSC to the college\r\n                        and identify a core team of passionate leaders. With\r\n                        guidance of Wagh SirFaculty Advisor of our GDSC) and\r\n                        permission of Principal Sir, I had to organize an intro\r\n                        event and this was the very first time I was going to\r\n                        deliver/host an event to the public in the college. I\r\n                        was nervous but excited. I didn’t expect a huge audience\r\n                        of 250+ students who came up for the event. That was the\r\n                        day when my public speaking skills got a boost and I\r\n                        became more confident than ever. I was nervous but yes,\r\n                        I had my friends supporting me throughout.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        From organizing 30 Days of Google Cloud, Android Study Jams, Flutter Festivals to Workshops on Github, Heroku, ML, Web, and a National Level Hackathon, I and my team have had a super dooper amazing journey throughout! We approached sponsors and luckily had the tech giant - Tech Mahindra as our sponsor for the hackathon, which had been our best event till date. Following which, we recently organized a series of workshops on various technologies.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        The best part was building our own website, for which\r\n                        the Web Team of GDSC worked really hard! A competition\r\n                        BloggerSpace was conducted on our own website which is a\r\n                        matter of pride for us. Website not only brags about the\r\n                        achievements of the club but also lets the community\r\n                        share their experiences and inspire people, and I think\r\n                        that’s the best part about our website.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Check it out - <a\r\n                          href=\"https://gdsc-aissmsioit.github.io/#/\"\r\n                          target=\"_blank\"\r\n                          rel=\"noreferrer\"\r\n                          className=\"text-primary\"\r\n                        >\r\n                          https://gdsc-aissmsioit.github.io/#/\r\n                        </a>\r\n                      </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                      One of the important steps was also creating a Volunteers\r\n                      Team of fresh minds from 1st year who will secure the\r\n                      future of GDSC at our college.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                  </ol>\r\n                  <h3>\r\n                    What have I achieved being a GDSC Lead? - Perks and Benefits\r\n                  </h3>\r\n                  <ol>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                      <strong>A strong personality - </strong>decision making,\r\n                      public speaking, handling critical situations, binding the\r\n                      team together, helping everyone thrive as leaders.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                      <strong>Insane network growth - </strong>GDSC gave me an\r\n                      opportunity to connect better with people, Leads all over\r\n                      India and the Globe.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Check out this post - <a\r\n                        href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CYJX1B3g8Lb/?utm_medium=copy_link\"\r\n                        target=\"_blank\"\r\n                        rel=\"noreferrer\"\r\n                        className=\"text-primary\"\r\n                      >\r\n                        https://www.instagram.com/p/CYJX1B3g8Lb/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n                      </a>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                      Amazing core team to work with - I didnt even know these\r\n                      folks before, but GDSC has built the friendship and the\r\n                      trust between us.
