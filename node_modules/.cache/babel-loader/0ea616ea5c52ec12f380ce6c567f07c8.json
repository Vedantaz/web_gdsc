It took me 4 to 5 takes to shoot a\r\n                      decent video. I wore a 30 Days of GCP T-shirt while\r\n                      recording the video that displayed my experience with the\r\n                      club.

The interviewers were very\r\n                      friendly and made sure I’m comfortable. A little\r\n                      nervousness always kicks in which made me miss an\r\n                      important point in the introduction. Also, I described my\r\n                      hobby as writing and mentioned my writing profile. I\r\n                      didn’t expect the interviewer to ask about my profile\r\n                      link. I wasn’t ready with it and hence he asked me to mail\r\n                      it to him after the interview. So along with the link, I\r\n                      also mailed that important point that I had missed. I\r\n                      wasn’t sure if I should do that or not but it’s at least\r\n                      better than having regrets.

Even before I\r\n                        opened it, my heart had already started pumping.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        I read the first line and I was so damn excited that I\r\n                        couldn’t even sit patiently to read the entire email.

But they were happy\r\n                        too, at least we now had a GDSC at our campus.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <li>Further steps - </li>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        We had an amazing introductory session by GDSC India\r\n                        where I got to connect with all the leads around the\r\n                        country.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Now the next step was to introduce GDSC to the college\r\n                        and identify a core team of passionate leaders. With\r\n                        guidance of Wagh SirFaculty Advisor of our GDSC) and\r\n                        permission of Principal Sir, I had to organize an intro\r\n                        event and this was the very first time I was going to\r\n                        deliver/host an event to the public in the college.

That was the\r\n                        day when my public speaking skills got a boost and I\r\n                        became more confident than ever.
